/*
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 7 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
n = 4
retrun
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
for this problem, we take two pointers, and first iterate the fast one ahead to n
and than iterate both fast and slow by one till fast points to the last node
at this point the slow pointer is pointing at n-size which the node we have to renmove
so, to remove slow -> next = slow -> next -> next
and then we return the list.
We introduce a dummy node for edge case, incase we have to remove head
